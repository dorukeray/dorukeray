## Life Purpose

I want to change the world and human race's destiny. Literally. <br>I want to give people something they can live up to, a better life opportunity for everyone. <br>I want to do this by creating new products for humanity, inventing something new, real, useful, meaningful. <br>I will NOT do that for the sake of being rich. But why not to have power in the right hands? <br>I am working to push the limits of human civilization forward and give everyone a better life

## Life Goals - simplified

### Universal Knowledge Resource -- most important one

- Create a "social knowledge network" to understand how people express, create, exchange <br>and perceive knowledge. It will be like a virtual - artificial experimentation medium.
- Create a universal "standard" or "protocol" on what knowledge is, and how we exchange/acquire it. 
- Create "Universal Knowledge Resource" using that protocol
- Create a "Knowledge Search Engine" to give people a way to get pure information from that resource
- Create a "P2P Knowledge Exchange Protocol"
- Create the Internet of Brains, in which a person or an AI can connect and exchange information fast, efficiently, securely using that protocol.
- Create a way to imitate the process of teaching/learning something with just a data transfer process. <br>So people can truly exchange knowledge. After that, humanity can understand the important thing is not storing information in our brains. What makes us different is how we use it.
- Well Done.
